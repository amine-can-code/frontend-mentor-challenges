## Overview

This project is a QR code component built as part of a Frontend Mentor challenge. It showcases my ability to integrate Tailwind CSS version 4 with HTML to create responsive web components. This implementation highlights the utility-first approach of Tailwind CSS, enabling a simple, yet effective UI component design.

### Steps

1. **HTML DOM Tree Creation**: I started by sketching out the HTML DOM tree to plan the structure of the component. This step helped ensure that the HTML markup was organized and semantically correct.

2. **Coding the HTML**: Once the structure was planned, I coded the HTML part of the project.

3. **Installing Tailwind CSS**: After setting up the HTML, I installed Tailwind CSS in the project using CLI commands available in the [official Tailwind CSS documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/tailwind-cli). This setup involved initializing Tailwind's configuration to tailor the utility classes to the specific needs of this project.

4. **Styling with Tailwind CSS**: With Tailwind CSS installed, I styled the component to match the required design. This step involved applying utility classes to the HTML elements to achieve the desired aesthetics and responsiveness.

### What I learned

This project was not only about coding but also about learning to use GitHub more effectively. Committing my first project, though small, was a significant step for me in understanding version control and best practices in software development. Here are some key takeaways:

- **Version Control with GitHub**: I learned the importance of using `.gitignore` to exclude unnecessary files from my repositories. For instance, committing `node_modules` is not recommended because it can clutter the project repository with dependencies that can be easily installed via `npm`. This advice was reinforced by community feedback on my submission.

- **Community Engagement**: Participating in the Frontend Mentor community was incredibly educational. For example, I contributed by suggesting semantic improvements to another participant's project, advising them to wrap an `<img>` tag inside a `<figure>` rather than a `<span>` for better HTML semantics.

- **Peer Feedback**: Receiving feedback from others was equally valuable. I learned that excluding `node_modules` by adding it to `.gitignore` is a best practice that keeps the repository clean and manageable.

I highly recommend [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) to anyone looking to improve their coding skills and understanding of best practices in a real-world project setting. Engaging with the community and exchanging feedback were crucial in deepening my understanding of both coding and version control systems.
